# CryptoNews
  A simple and effective website designed to provide information regarding the crypto currencies. For the api, I have used the demo version of 'coin-gekko' which often give some problems but is mainly effective.
  This website was build with the clear intention of learing more about ReactJS states and which is why the designing of this website is so basic.  


## Basic HomePage 
### This shows the top 4 cryptocurrencies with their market rank, market cap value and current price. You can switch the currencies between USD and INR.

## Coin information with chart
### You can get the chart by just clicking on the coin. react-google-charts is used to display the charts and react-router to switch between pages.
